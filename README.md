Inheritance in Java is the method to create a hierarchy between classes by inheriting from other classes. Java Inheritance is transitive - so if Sedan extends Car and Car extends Vehicle, then Sedan is also inherited from the Vehicle class.
First is multiple inheritances, when a single child class inherits from multiple parent classes.
The second is hybrid inheritance, a bunch of two or more than one kinds of inheritance known as hybrid inheritance.
A few vital terminologies related to the concept are:
Class: Itâ€™s elaborated as a bunch of objects sharing common properties. It is a kind of blueprint of produced objects.
Sub Class: Even referred to as a derived or extended subclass, this category inherits the options from another class. Together with the inheritable fields and strategies, the class generated from the category will add fields and strategies of its own. 
Super Class: The superclass also known as the parent class represents the category whose options are units inheritable by a subclass. 
Reusability: As the name is defined, it is a technique of reusability that permits the user to make a class while using the methods of the new class. having the fields or strategies of associate in nursing already existing class. It permits reusing the code.
